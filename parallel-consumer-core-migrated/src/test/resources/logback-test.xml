This is a configuration file for the Logback logging framework in Java. It specifies the logging levels for different loggers in the application.

To convert this to C#, you can use the built-in logging framework in .NET, such as Serilog or NLog. Here's an example of how you can convert this configuration to Serilog in C#:

```csharp
using Serilog;
using Serilog.Events;
using Serilog.Formatting.Compact;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
            .MinimumLevel.Verbose()
            .WriteTo.Console(new CompactJsonFormatter())
            .CreateLogger();

        Log.Logger.Information("Hello, world!");

        Log.CloseAndFlush();
    }
}
```

In this example, we configure Serilog to log at the `Verbose` level and write the logs to the console using the `CompactJsonFormatter`. You can customize the logging levels and output format according to your needs.

Note that you need to install the Serilog and Serilog.Formatting.Compact packages from NuGet to use Serilog in your C# project.
