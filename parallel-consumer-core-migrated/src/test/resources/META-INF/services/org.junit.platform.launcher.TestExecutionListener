Unfortunately, I cannot access external links or specific files on GitHub. However, I can provide you with a general outline of how to convert a Java class to C#. 

1. Start by creating a new C# class with the same name as the Java class (`MyRunListener`).
2. Import any necessary namespaces at the top of the C# file.
3. Convert the class declaration by replacing the `class` keyword with `public class`.
4. Convert any member variables by updating the data types and access modifiers as needed.
5. Convert any methods by updating the return type, access modifiers, and parameter types as needed.
6. Update any Java-specific syntax or APIs to their equivalent C# counterparts. For example, replace `System.out.println()` with `Console.WriteLine()`.
7. If the Java class extends or implements any other classes or interfaces, update the C# class accordingly using the appropriate syntax (`:` for inheritance and `,` for multiple interfaces).
8. Finally, review the converted code and make any necessary adjustments to ensure it adheres to C# coding conventions and best practices.

Please note that without the specific code from the `MyRunListener` class, it is difficult to provide a more detailed conversion. If you can provide the relevant code snippets, I can assist you further in converting them to C#.
